            <p> <b>Hi, you can call me Red!</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                I've always loved technology, but my journey to web development is not a direct one.
                <br>
                <br>
                My first experience with technology came with my first console - a PS1. I was amazed that such a tiny device could produce content almost from nothing!
                However, computers always held my interest more than consoles. Games were better - that was reason enough for me. 
                The concept of building my own system from scratch quickly became my goal.
                How hard could it be? As it turns out - hard.
                My first PC rattled constantly - and I still don't know why.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now that I had a computer of my own I had to learn to manage it. "Not Responding? Why?"
                Fortunately these new skills were useful. I quickly became the perpetually frustrated I.T. guy. 
                Helping others with their computer issues became a regular experience. Whilst frustrating at times, there was no greater satisfaction than overcoming the problem.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Cool, so what about now?</strong>
                Today I am a 24 year old web developer based in Auckland. 
                This year I graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Arts, double majoring in Psychology and Sociology.
                The course was an incredible, late-night, coffee-fueled endeavour. Whilst I enjoyed every moment, it failed capture my heart as a profession.
                Providence soon had an answer to my issues. In my final semester of study, I happened to forget AdBlock on a fresh system and noticed an ad.
                "Get your free 30 day code bootcamp!". Code! How hard could that be? I've worked with computers all my life!
                <br>

                No stranger to frustration and coffee-for-sleep substitutes, I juggled both university and a bootcamp.
                Now, many early mornings, warm beanies and empty mugs later I am building a career out of my passion.
